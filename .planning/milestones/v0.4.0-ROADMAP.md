# Milestone v0.4.0: Foundation

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-30
**Phases:** 1-2
**Total Plans:** 6

## Overview

Milestone v0.4.0 Foundation establishes Kata Agents as an independent, compliant fork with proper CI/CD tooling and complete rebranding. Two phases: first build automation and upstream management, then complete trademark compliance and distribution setup.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Tooling

**Goal**: CI/CD validates every PR and produces distributable artifacts, with documented upstream management strategy.
**Depends on**: None (foundation phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — CI workflows (PR validation + release fix)
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Upstream management documentation

**Details:**
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with validate + build-mac jobs
- Fixed `.github/workflows/release.yml` script references
- Created `UPSTREAM.md` documenting fork management strategy
- Established upstream/sync branch pattern for cherry-picking

### Phase 2: Rebranding

**Goal**: Complete trademark compliance by removing all Craft references and establishing Kata Agents identity for distribution.
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (CI must pass before release)
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Product name and metadata (BRAND-01, BRAND-02)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Application icons (BRAND-04)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — In-app logos and React components (BRAND-05)
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Domain references and release configuration (BRAND-03, DIST-01)

**Details:**
- Updated electron-builder.yml with `sh.kata.desktop` bundle ID
- Generated Kata application icons (icns, ico, png, svg)
- Created KataSymbol, KataAppIcon, KataLogo React components
- Removed/disabled all craft.do domain references
- Configured GitHub releases for auto-update
- Bumped version to 0.4.0

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- PR builds use arm64 only (fast feedback, full matrix on release)
- upstream/sync branch mirrors upstream/main
- Cherry-pick workflow for selective change adoption
- Env var migration supports both KATA_ and CRAFT_ prefixes
- DMG background kept existing neutral swirl pattern
- KataLogo uses simple text-based SVG
- Slack OAuth disabled with graceful error (needs HTTPS relay)
- Auto-update changed to GitHub releases

**Issues Resolved:**
- All craft.do references removed from active code paths
- Config paths migrated from .craft-agent to .kata-agents
- macOS code signing and notarization configured

**Issues Deferred:**
- Slack OAuth (requires HTTPS relay server at kata.sh)
- External docs links (requires docs.kata.sh)
- Version manifest (requires version API at kata.sh)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Some internal class names still use "Craft" prefix (functional, legal compliance met)
- MCP docs server commented out (awaits kata.sh infrastructure)
