## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

**v0.7.0 architecture decision (brainstorm 2026-02-07):**
- Hybrid architecture selected over minimal (NanoClaw-style) and gateway (OpenClaw-style)
- Daemon as Bun subprocess of Electron (not WebSocket gateway)
- Plugin contract with 3 registration methods (registerChannel/registerTool/registerService)
- Dual ingress channel adapter (poll/subscribe)
- New `daemon` permission mode with tool allowlist
- SQLite for daemon state, first-party plugins only
- launchd/systemd deferred to v0.8.0+
- Full brainstorm: .planning/brainstorms/2026-02-07T06-16-brainstorm/SUMMARY.md

**Phase 11 Plan 01 decisions:**
- SQLite snake_case columns mapped to camelCase QueuedMessage fields at the dequeue boundary
- Payload stored as JSON TEXT, serialized on enqueue, deserialized on dequeue

**Phase 11 Plan 02 decisions:**
- CONFIG_DIR computed inline in electron main process (no subpath export for config/paths)
- DaemonManager does not auto-start; Phase 12+ triggers start when channels are configured

### Active Todos

None.

### Known Blockers

None.

### Technical Debt

**From v0.6.0:**
- GitStatusBadge.tsx exists but unused (inline GitBranchBadge used instead)
- Deprecated GET_GIT_BRANCH channel retained for backward compatibility
- isGitRepository() exported but not called externally

**From v0.6.1:**
- Coverage thresholds set conservatively (regression guard, not aspirational)
- MCP and workspace switching E2E tests deferred
- Mock infrastructure for CI-based chat/MCP testing deferred (issue #49)

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-02-07
**Stopped at:** Phase 11 verified and completed — PR #79 ready
**Resume file:** None

**Next action:** Merge PR #79, then plan Phase 12 (Channel Adapters)
