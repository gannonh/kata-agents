## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. System tray icon appears on launch
expected: After launching the app, a system tray icon appears in the macOS menu bar using a template image
result: pass

### 2. Tray context menu options
expected: Right-clicking (or clicking) the tray icon shows a menu with: Show Window, daemon status label, Start/Stop Daemon, Quit
result: pass

### 3. App stays alive when all windows closed and daemon running
expected: Closing all windows does not quit the app when the daemon is running — the tray icon remains
result: pass

### 4. DaemonStatusIndicator shows in UI
expected: The daemon status indicator (colored dot) appears in the renderer, reflecting the current daemon state (e.g., "stopped" with appropriate color)
result: pass

### 5. Daemon state atom updates from IPC events
expected: Starting/stopping the daemon updates the status indicator in real-time without manual refresh
result: pass

### 6. Session.channel type on daemon-created sessions
expected: Sessions created by the daemon carry a channel field (adapter, slug, displayName) visible in session metadata
result: skipped
reason: No channel adapter configured for live message routing

### 7. Channel session badge in session list
expected: Daemon-originated sessions show an adapter-specific icon badge (Hash for Slack, MessageCircle for WhatsApp, Radio for generic) in the session list
result: skipped
reason: No channel adapter configured for live message routing

### 8. Settings navigator shows Channels entry
expected: The Settings navigator includes a "Channels" item with a Radio icon and description "Daemon, Slack, WhatsApp channels"
result: pass

### 9. Channel settings page loads
expected: Clicking the Channels settings entry routes to the ChannelSettingsPage showing daemon status, channel list (or empty state with CLI instructions), and Start/Stop button
result: pass

### 10. Channel enable/disable toggle
expected: Each configured channel has an inline toggle to enable/disable it, showing the adapter icon and slug in the same row
result: skipped
reason: No channel configs present to test toggle

### 11. Channel delete action
expected: Each configured channel has a delete action that removes the channel config
result: skipped
reason: No channel configs present to test delete

### 12. Typecheck and lint pass
expected: `bun run typecheck:all` and `bun run lint:electron` complete with zero errors
result: pass
