# Phase 02 Plan 03: In-App Logos and React Components Summary

**One-liner:** Replaced all Craft* icon components with Kata* equivalents, updated kata_mark.svg asset, and updated branding.ts constants.

## Objective Achieved

All in-app Craft logos, symbols, and React icon components have been replaced with Kata branding. The application UI now displays Kata identity throughout splash screen, onboarding, menus, and component playground.

## Key Changes

### Task 1: SVG Asset and Icon Component Renames

**Files created:**
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/assets/kata_mark.svg` - Kata mark (copied from assets/brand/mark.svg)
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/components/icons/KataSymbol.tsx` - Main symbol component
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/components/icons/KataAppIcon.tsx` - App icon component with size prop
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/components/icons/KataLogo.tsx` - Text-based KATA wordmark

**Files removed:**
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/assets/craft_logo_c.svg`
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/components/icons/CraftAgentsSymbol.tsx`
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/components/icons/CraftAppIcon.tsx`
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/components/icons/CraftAgentsLogo.tsx`

### Task 2: Component Import Updates

Updated all files that imported Craft icon components:

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| SplashScreen.tsx | CraftAgentsSymbol -> KataSymbol, updated comment |
| WelcomeStep.tsx | Import + usage + "Welcome to Kata Desktop" |
| CompletionStep.tsx | Import + usage |
| ReauthScreen.tsx | Import + usage + "Kata Desktop" text |
| AppMenu.tsx | Import + usage + "Quit Kata Desktop" |
| PlaygroundApp.tsx | Import + usage |
| registry/icons.tsx | Imports + registry entries |

### Task 3: Branding Constants

Updated `packages/shared/src/branding.ts`:

```typescript
// New primary exports
export const KATA_LOGO = [
  ' ╦╔═ ╔═╗ ╔╦╗ ╔═╗',
  ' ╠╩╗ ╠═╣  ║  ╠═╣',
  ' ╩ ╩ ╩ ╩  ╩  ╩ ╩',
] as const;

export const KATA_LOGO_HTML = KATA_LOGO.map((line) => line.trimEnd()).join('\n');

// Legacy aliases (deprecated)
export const CRAFT_LOGO = KATA_LOGO;
export const CRAFT_LOGO_HTML = KATA_LOGO_HTML;

// Disabled until Kata infrastructure ready
export const VIEWER_URL = '';
```

## Verification Results

All success criteria passed:

1. `kata_mark.svg` exists at expected path
2. `KataSymbol.tsx` exports `KataSymbol` function
3. No `CraftAgentsSymbol` references remain in renderer
4. No `craft_logo_c` references remain in renderer
5. `bun run typecheck:all` passes
6. `KATA_LOGO` export present in branding.ts

## Commits

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| 560bcbd | feat(02-03): replace Craft icons with Kata branding components |
| cc3d0a1 | feat(02-03): update all component imports to use Kata branding |
| 84a2061 | feat(02-03): update branding.ts with Kata constants |

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Next Phase Readiness

This plan is complete. The renderer now displays Kata branding throughout:
- Splash screen shows Kata mark
- App menu shows Kata icon
- Onboarding screens show Kata branding
- "Craft Agents" text replaced with "Kata Desktop"

**Note:** Some other files still contain `craft.do` URLs (ChatPage.tsx, AppMenu.tsx for docs, AppShell.tsx). These are out of scope for this plan and would be addressed in a future infrastructure/documentation plan when Kata URLs are available.
