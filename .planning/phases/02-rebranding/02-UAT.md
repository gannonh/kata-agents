## Testing Notes

### Dev vs Production Build
- `bun run electron:start` runs in dev mode - shows "Electron" branding in About dialog and menu bar
- For accurate branding UAT, must build packaged app: `cd apps/electron && bunx electron-builder --mac`
- Packaged app location: `apps/electron/release/mac-arm64/Kata Desktop.app`

### README Attribution
README.md references to "Craft Agents" are intentional - they're required attribution for the fork (LICENSE/NOTICE compliance).
