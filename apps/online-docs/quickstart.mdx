## Understanding Permission Modes

Kata Agents has three permission modes to control what actions the agent can take:

| Mode | Display | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| `safe` | Explore | Read-only, blocks all write operations |
| `ask` | Ask to Edit | Prompts for approval (default) |
| `allow-all` | Auto | Auto-approves all commands |

Press **SHIFT+TAB** to cycle through permission modes during a conversation.
