## Overview

Kata Agents uses a three-level permission system to control what actions the agent can take. This gives you fine-grained control over safety and autonomy.

## Permission Modes

| Mode | Display | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| `safe` | Explore | Read-only, blocks all write operations | Initial exploration, untrusted contexts |
| `ask` | Ask to Edit | Prompts for approval before executing commands | Balanced control (default) |
| `allow-all` | Auto | Auto-approves all commands | Trusted contexts, automation |

## Cycling Through Modes

Press **SHIFT+TAB** during a conversation to cycle through permission modes:

```
Explore → Ask to Edit → Auto → Explore → ...
```

The current mode is displayed in the chat interface toolbar.

## Safe Mode (Explore)

**Read-only mode** - Blocks all write operations

### What's Allowed:
- Reading files
- Searching code
- Analyzing existing content
- Running read-only commands (e.g., `git status`, `ls`)

### What's Blocked:
- Writing or editing files
- Running potentially destructive commands
- Making API calls that modify data
- Git commits or pushes

<Tip>
  Use Explore mode when first investigating a codebase or when you want to prevent any modifications.
</Tip>

## Ask Mode (Ask to Edit)

**Prompt for approval** - Default mode

### How It Works:
1. Agent attempts an action that requires permission
2. You see a prompt with details about the action
3. You approve or deny the action
4. Agent proceeds based on your decision

### Customizable Rules:
You can configure which commands require approval and which are auto-approved. This is useful for:

- Auto-approving safe commands (like `git status`)
- Always prompting for destructive operations (like `rm`)
- Project-specific command policies

## Allow-All Mode (Auto)

**Auto-approve everything** - Maximum autonomy

### When to Use:
- Trusted automation tasks
- Well-defined, bounded operations
- When you want maximum speed

### Safety Considerations:
<Warning>
  Auto mode gives the agent full autonomy. Only use this in contexts where you trust the agent to make decisions, or when the scope is clearly bounded.
</Warning>

## Permission Prompts

When in Ask mode, permission prompts show:

- **Command**: The exact command to be executed
- **Context**: Why the agent wants to run this command
- **Risk Level**: Indication of potential impact
- **Approve/Deny**: Your decision

You can also:
- **Remember Decision**: Auto-approve this specific command in the future
- **Change Mode**: Switch to Auto or Explore mode

## Customizing Permission Rules

You can configure per-workspace rules for which commands require approval:

```json
{
  "permissionRules": {
    "autoApprove": [
      "git status",
      "git diff",
      "ls",
      "cat"
    ],
    "alwaysAsk": [
      "git push",
      "rm",
      "npm publish"
    ],
    "blocked": [
      "rm -rf /",
      "sudo"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Explore">
    When working with a new codebase or unfamiliar context, start in Explore mode to understand what you're working with before allowing modifications.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Ask for Most Work">
    Ask to Edit mode (the default) provides a good balance of control and efficiency. You maintain oversight while not being overwhelmed with prompts for safe operations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reserve Auto for Trusted Tasks">
    Only switch to Auto mode for well-defined tasks in trusted contexts, or when you've already reviewed the agent's plan.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configure Rules">
    Take time to configure permission rules for your workspace. This reduces friction while maintaining safety.
