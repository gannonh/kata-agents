## What is a Workspace?

A workspace in Kata Agents is a container for organizing related sessions, sources, skills, and settings. Each workspace has its own:

- **Working Directory**: Filesystem location for file operations
- **Sessions**: Collection of conversation threads
- **Sources**: Connected MCP servers, APIs, and filesystems
- **Skills**: Custom agent instructions
- **Settings**: Workspace-specific configuration
- **Theme**: Optional workspace-level theme override

## Why Use Workspaces?

Workspaces help you:

- **Separate contexts**: Keep work projects separate from personal tasks
- **Organize sessions**: Group related conversations together
- **Configure sources**: Different MCP servers and APIs per workspace
- **Customize skills**: Workspace-specific agent behavior
- **Manage settings**: Independent configuration per workspace

## Creating a Workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Workspace Switcher">
    Click the workspace name in the sidebar or use the keyboard shortcut
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Workspace">
    Click "New Workspace" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Workspace">
    - Enter a name for your workspace
    - Select a working directory
    - Optionally configure initial sources
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Working">
    Begin creating sessions in your new workspace
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workspace Structure

Each workspace is stored in your configuration directory:

```
~/.kata-agents/workspaces/{workspace-id}/
├── config.json         # Workspace settings
├── theme.json          # Optional theme override
├── sessions/           # Session data (JSONL files)
├── sources/            # Connected sources configuration
├── skills/             # Custom agent instructions
└── statuses/           # Status workflow configuration
```

## Workspace Settings

Workspaces can be customized with:

- **Working Directory**: Default location for file operations
- **Display Name**: How the workspace appears in the UI
- **Icon**: Custom icon (future feature)
- **Default Permission Mode**: Starting permission level for new sessions
- **Source Connections**: MCP servers, REST APIs, filesystems

## Switching Workspaces

You can quickly switch between workspaces:

1. Click the workspace name in the sidebar
2. Select a different workspace from the list
3. The app will switch context and load that workspace's sessions

<Note>
  Each workspace maintains independent session history and configuration. Switching workspaces does not affect sessions in other workspaces.
</Note>

## Workspace Themes

Workspaces support cascading themes:

1. **App-level theme**: Default theme for all workspaces
2. **Workspace-level theme**: Optional override per workspace

This allows you to visually distinguish workspaces or match project branding.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Project-based Organization">
    Create a workspace for each major project or client. This keeps sessions, skills, and sources relevant to that project together.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Environment Separation">
    Use separate workspaces for development, staging, and production environments if working with different API endpoints or configurations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Context Switching">
    When switching between different types of work (coding, writing, research), use different workspaces to maintain appropriate context and skills.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Source Management">
    Connect sources relevant to each workspace. For example, a coding workspace might have GitHub and Linear MCPs, while a writing workspace might have Google Drive and Notion.
  </Accordion>
