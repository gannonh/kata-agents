## What is a Session?

A session in Kata Agents is a conversation thread with Claude. Each session maintains its own context, message history, and state. Think of sessions as individual chat threads, similar to email threads or Slack conversations.

## Session Features

### Multi-Session Inbox

Kata Agents provides a desktop app interface with session management features:

- **Inbox/Archive**: Sessions organized by workflow status
- **Flagging**: Mark important sessions for quick access
- **Status Workflow**: Todo → In Progress → Needs Review → Done
- **Session Naming**: AI-generated titles or manual naming
- **Session Persistence**: Full conversation history saved to disk

### Session Organization

Sessions can be organized using several mechanisms:

## Session Lifecycle

1. **Create**: Start a new session with `Cmd+N` or the "New Chat" button
2. **Active**: Interact with Claude, send messages, receive responses
3. **Status Updates**: Move through your workflow (Todo → In Progress → Done)
4. **Archive**: Completed sessions move to archive but remain searchable
5. **Persistence**: All sessions are saved to disk in JSONL format

## Session Context

Each session maintains:

- **Message History**: Full conversation thread
- **Working Directory**: Current filesystem context
- **Git Context**: Branch and PR information (if available)
- **Permission Mode**: Current permission level (Explore/Ask/Auto)
- **Connected Sources**: MCP servers and APIs available to this session
- **Skills**: Workspace-level agent instructions

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+N` | New chat |
| `Cmd+1/2/3` | Focus sidebar/list/chat |
| `SHIFT+TAB` | Cycle permission modes |
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Shift+Enter` | New line |

## Session Storage

Sessions are persisted as JSONL files in your workspace directory:

```
~/.kata-agents/workspaces/{workspace-id}/sessions/
├── session-1.jsonl
├── session-2.jsonl
└── session-3.jsonl
```

Each line in a JSONL file represents a turn in the conversation, allowing for efficient streaming and recovery.
