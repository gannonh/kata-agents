## What are Sources?

Sources are external data connections that extend your agent's capabilities. Kata Agents supports three types of sources:

1. **MCP Servers**: Model Context Protocol servers for structured integrations
2. **REST APIs**: Direct API connections (Google, Slack, Microsoft)
3. **Local Files**: Filesystem access for reading and writing files

## Source Types

## MCP Servers

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is a standard for connecting AI agents to external services.

### Supported MCP Transports

- **stdio**: Local subprocess (most MCP servers)
- **SSE**: Remote server-sent events connection

### Popular MCP Servers

| Server | Description | Transport |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Linear** | Issue tracking and project management | stdio |
| **GitHub** | Repository management, issues, PRs | stdio |
| **Notion** | Notes and knowledge base | stdio |
| **Filesystem** | Local file access | stdio |
| **PostgreSQL** | Database queries | stdio |
| **Brave Search** | Web search | stdio |

### Adding an MCP Server

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Sources Settings">
    Navigate to workspace settings → Sources
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add MCP Server">
    Click "Add MCP Server" and select from available servers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Connection">
    - **stdio**: Provide command and arguments
    - **SSE**: Provide server URL and authentication
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Verify the server is responding correctly
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Filesystem MCP

```json
{
  "name": "filesystem",
  "type": "mcp",
  "transport": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/directory"]
}
```

## REST API Sources

Kata Agents has built-in support for popular REST APIs with OAuth authentication.

### Supported APIs

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Google">
    - **Gmail**: Read and send emails
    - **Calendar**: View and create events
    - **Drive**: Access files and folders

    Requires OAuth 2.0 authentication
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Slack">
    - **Messages**: Read and send messages
    - **Channels**: List and search channels
    - **Users**: Get user information

    Requires Slack OAuth
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Microsoft">
    - **Outlook**: Email access
    - **Calendar**: Event management
    - **OneDrive**: File access

    Requires Microsoft OAuth
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Adding a REST API Source

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Sources">
    Workspace settings → Sources → Add Source
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select API">
    Choose from Google, Slack, or Microsoft
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Complete OAuth flow to grant permissions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Scopes">
    Select which services to enable (Gmail, Calendar, etc.)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Local Filesystem

The filesystem source gives your agent access to local files and directories.

### Security Considerations

<Warning>
  Filesystem access is powerful. Only grant access to directories you trust the agent to read and write.
</Warning>

The filesystem MCP:
- Respects permission modes (read-only in Explore mode)
- Can be scoped to specific directories
- Follows symbolic links carefully
- Filters sensitive files (.env, credentials, etc.)

### Environment Variable Filtering

When spawning local MCP servers, sensitive environment variables are automatically filtered to prevent credential leakage:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- Other common credential variables

To explicitly pass an environment variable to a specific MCP server, use the `env` field in the source configuration.

## Large Response Handling

Tool responses exceeding ~60KB are automatically summarized using Claude Haiku with intent-aware context. The `_intent` field is injected into MCP tool schemas to preserve summarization focus.

This ensures:
- Responses stay within context limits
- Agent receives relevant information
- User sees full responses when needed

## Source Management

### Enabling/Disabling Sources

Sources can be temporarily disabled without removing them:

1. Navigate to workspace settings → Sources
2. Toggle the source on/off
3. Disabled sources don't appear in agent context

### Removing Sources

To permanently remove a source:

1. Navigate to workspace settings → Sources
2. Select the source to remove
3. Click "Remove Source"
4. Confirm deletion

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scope Filesystem Access">
    Only grant filesystem access to the directories needed for the task. Don't give blanket access to your home directory.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use MCP When Available">
    MCP servers provide structured, validated access to services. Prefer MCP over raw API access when available.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Connections">
    After adding a source, test it with a simple query to verify it's working correctly before relying on it for complex tasks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Permissions">
    Periodically review which sources are connected and remove any that are no longer needed.
