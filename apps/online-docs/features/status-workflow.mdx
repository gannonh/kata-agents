## Overview

The status workflow system in Kata Agents allows you to organize sessions based on where they are in your process. Like Kanban boards or issue trackers, you can move sessions through different states.

## Default Statuses

Kata Agents comes with a default workflow:

```
Todo → In Progress → Needs Review → Done
```

But you can customize this to match your own workflow.

## Status Properties

Each status has:

- **Name**: Display name (e.g., "In Progress")
- **Icon**: Visual indicator
- **Color**: Theme color for the status
- **Order**: Position in the workflow
- **Type**: Category (inbox, active, review, done, archived)

## Inbox vs Archive

Sessions are organized into two main views:

### Inbox
Active sessions that need attention:
- Todo
- In Progress
- Needs Review

### Archive
Completed or inactive sessions:
- Done
- Cancelled
- On Hold

## Custom Workflows

You can create workflows that match your process:

### Software Development
```
Backlog → Planning → Development → Code Review → Testing → Deployed
```

### Customer Support
```
New → Investigating → Waiting on Customer → Resolved → Closed
```

### Content Creation
```
Ideas → Drafting → Editing → Review → Published
```

### Research
```
Queue → Reading → Note Taking → Analysis → Writing → Complete
```

## Configuring Statuses

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Status Settings">
    Navigate to workspace settings → Statuses
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add/Edit Status">
    - Click "Add Status" or edit existing
    - Set name, icon, color, type
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reorder">
    Drag statuses to reorder the workflow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Changes apply immediately to the workspace
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Status Configuration Format

Statuses are stored in your workspace directory:

```json
{
  "statuses": [
    {
      "id": "todo",
      "name": "Todo",
      "icon": "circle",
      "color": "#808080",
      "order": 0,
      "type": "inbox"
    },
    {
      "id": "in-progress",
      "name": "In Progress",
      "icon": "clock",
      "color": "#3b82f6",
      "order": 1,
      "type": "active"
    },
    {
      "id": "done",
      "name": "Done",
      "icon": "check-circle",
      "color": "#10b981",
      "order": 2,
      "type": "done"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Moving Sessions

Sessions can be moved between statuses:

### Via UI
1. Select session in list
2. Click status dropdown
3. Choose new status

### Via Keyboard
Configure keyboard shortcuts for quick status changes.

### Via Agent
Ask the agent to update status:
```
Move this session to "Needs Review"
```

## Filtering by Status

The session list can be filtered by status:

- **All**: Show all sessions
- **Inbox**: Active sessions only
- **Archive**: Completed sessions only
- **Specific Status**: Filter to one status

## Status-Based Rules

You can configure rules based on status:

### Auto-Archive
Automatically archive sessions after N days in "Done" status.

### Notifications
Get notified when sessions enter specific statuses.

### Auto-Status
Automatically move sessions based on activity:
- No activity for 7 days → "On Hold"
- New message received → "In Progress"

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep It Simple">
    Start with 4-6 statuses. Too many statuses create cognitive overhead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Match Your Process">
    Model your actual workflow, not an idealized one. The system should reflect reality.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Clear Names">
    Status names should be immediately understandable. Avoid jargon or abbreviations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Define Done">
    Be clear about what "done" means. Does it mean shipped? Reviewed? Closed?
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular Grooming">
    Periodically review and update session statuses to keep your inbox current.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Status Types

### inbox
Sessions that need immediate attention. Shown in the main inbox view.

### active
Sessions currently being worked on. Highlighted in the UI.

### review
Sessions waiting for review or feedback.

### done
Completed sessions. Can be auto-archived.

### archived
Long-term storage. Not shown in default views.

### cancelled
Sessions that were started but not completed.

## Integration with Flagging

Statuses and flags work together:

- **Status**: Where the session is in your workflow
- **Flag**: Whether it's important/urgent

This allows for prioritization:
1. Flagged + In Progress (urgent, active)
2. Flagged + Todo (urgent, not started)
3. Unflagged + In Progress (normal priority, active)
4. Unflagged + Todo (normal priority, backlog)
