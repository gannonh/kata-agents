## What are Skills?

Skills are reusable instruction sets that customize how your agent behaves in specific contexts. Think of them as specialized personas or expertise modules that you can activate when needed.

## Why Use Skills?

</CardGroup>

## How Skills Work

Skills are markdown files stored in your workspace directory:

```
~/.kata-agents/workspaces/{workspace-id}/skills/
├── code-review.md
├── documentation.md
└── debugging.md
```

When you invoke a skill, its contents are injected into the system prompt, giving the agent additional context and instructions.

## Creating a Skill

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Skills">
    Workspace settings → Skills
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Skill">
    Click "Add Skill" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Skill">
    Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "code-review", "api-design")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Instructions">
    Add the instructions in markdown format
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Test">
    Save the skill and test it in a session
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Skill Format

Skills are written in markdown with optional front matter:

```markdown
---
name: Code Review
description: Thorough code review with security focus
tags: [code, security, review]
---

# Code Review Instructions

When reviewing code, follow these steps:

1. **Security Analysis**
   - Check for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
   - Review authentication and authorization
   - Look for injection risks

2. **Code Quality**
   - Assess readability and maintainability
   - Check for code duplication
   - Verify error handling

3. **Performance**
   - Identify potential bottlenecks
   - Review database query efficiency
   - Check for unnecessary computations

4. **Best Practices**
   - Verify adherence to language idioms
   - Check test coverage
   - Review documentation
```

## Using Skills

### Invoke in Chat

Skills can be invoked using slash commands:

```
/skill code-review
```

Or referenced by name:

```
Use the code-review skill to review this PR
```

### Auto-Activation

Skills can be configured to auto-activate based on:
- File types being edited
- Keywords in messages
- Specific directories
- Custom rules

## Example Skills

### Code Review

Focus on security, performance, and best practices when reviewing code.

### Documentation Writer

Generate comprehensive documentation with examples and proper formatting.

### Debugging Assistant

Systematic debugging approach with logging, hypothesis testing, and root cause analysis.

### API Design

RESTful API design principles, versioning, and documentation standards.

### Test Writer

Generate thorough test cases covering edge cases and error conditions.

## Skill Variables

Skills can use variables that are filled in at runtime:

```markdown
# Project: {{workspace.name}}

Working directory: {{workspace.path}}
Current branch: {{git.branch}}
```

Available variables:
- `workspace.name`: Workspace display name
- `workspace.path`: Working directory path
- `git.branch`: Current Git branch
- `git.pr`: Current PR (if exists)
- `session.name`: Session name

## Sharing Skills

### Export

Skills can be exported as markdown files for sharing:

1. Navigate to Skills settings
2. Select the skill to export
3. Click "Export"
4. Save the `.md` file

### Import

Import skills from other workspaces or shared files:

1. Navigate to Skills settings
2. Click "Import Skill"
3. Select the `.md` file
4. Skill is added to your workspace

### Skill Library

Consider creating a shared skill library:

```bash
~/kata-skills/
├── code-review.md
├── documentation.md
├── api-design.md
└── debugging.md
```

Import skills from this library as needed.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific">
    The more specific your instructions, the better the agent can follow them. Include examples and counter-examples.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep Skills Focused">
    Each skill should address one area of expertise. Don't create mega-skills that try to do everything.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Structured Format">
    Organize instructions with headings, lists, and clear sections. This makes them easier to follow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test and Iterate">
    Test your skills in real sessions and refine based on results. Skills improve with use.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Assumptions">
    If your skill assumes certain context or tools are available, document that clearly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Features

### Skill Composition

Skills can reference other skills:

```markdown
Use the code-review skill for security analysis, then apply
the documentation skill to update the README.
```

### Conditional Logic

Skills can include conditional instructions:

```markdown
If working with Python:
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints

If working with TypeScript:
- Follow strict mode
- Use explicit return types
```

### Dynamic Content

Skills can generate content based on workspace state:

```markdown
Current project uses {{detected.language}} with {{detected.framework}}.
Apply language-specific best practices.
```
