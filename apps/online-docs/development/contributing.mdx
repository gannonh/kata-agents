```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

We use ESLint and TypeScript for code quality:

```bash
# Lint code
bun run lint:electron

# Type check
bun run typecheck:all
```

Follow these conventions:
- Use TypeScript for all code
- Follow existing code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions focused and small
